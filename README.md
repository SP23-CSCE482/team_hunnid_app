## Introduction ##

Our team is creating an app made to personalize learning using AI. A user logs in using their Google account, and is then prompted to upload an assignment, indicating which questions they got incorrect. This information is then fed into a model to extrapolate what topics are being covered in each question. This is then fed into a second model, where the user will get recommended sources to study from based on the topics they struggle the most with.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Requirements ##

This code has been run and tested on:

* Nodejs - v16.9.1
* Npm- 9.4.0
* React - 18.2.0


## External Deps  ##

* Docker - Download latest version at https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
* Heroku CLI - Download latest version at https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli
* Git - Downloat latest version at https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git

## Installation ##

Download this code repository by using git:

 `git clone https://github.com/SP23-CSCE482/team_hunnid_app`
 
## Tests ##

Tests that are available for the app can be run by using the command:

  `npm test`
  
### Execute Code

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Environmental Variables/Files ##

Google OAuth2 support requires two keys to function as intended: Client ID and Client Secret

Create a new file called application.yml in the /config folder and add the following lines:

  `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID: 'YOUR_GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID_HERE'`

  `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET: 'YOUR_GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET_HERE'`
  
## Deployment 

Setup a Heroku account: https://signup.heroku.com/

From the heroku dashboard select `New` -> `Create New Pipline`

Name the pipeline, and link the respective git repo to the pipline

Our application does not need any extra options, so select `Enable Review Apps` right away

Click `New app` under review apps, and link your test branch from your repo

Under staging app, select `Create new app` and link your main branch from your repo

--------

To add enviornment variables to enable google oauth2 functionality, head over to the settings tab on the pipeline dashboard

Scroll down until `Reveal config vars`

Add both your client id and your secret id, with fields `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` respectively

Now once your pipeline has built the apps, select `Open app` to open the app

With the staging app, if you would like to move the app to production, click the two up and down arrows and select `Move to production`

And now your application is setup and in production mode!


## CI/CD ##

For continuous development, we set up Heroku to automatically deploy our apps when their respective github branches are updated.

  `Review app: test branch`

  `Production app: main branch`

For continuous integration, we set up a Github action to run our specs, security checks, linter, etc. after every push or pull-request. This allows us to automatically ensure that our code is working as intended.
